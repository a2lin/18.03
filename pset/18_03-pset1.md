#####Part I.

######1.4 #66
Let's model the system as follows:
$$s(t) = rt + O$$ where $$$s(t)$$$ is the amount of snow per unit distance $$$d$$$ at time $$$t$$$, $$$r$$$ being the rate of snowfall. If we let $$$a$$$ be the amount of snow cleared by the snowplow per unit time $$$t$$$, and $$$x$$$ be the position of the snowplow at time $$$t$$$, we can observe the following equation:
$${dx\over dt} = {a \over rt + O}$$.
This equation states that the rate of movement per unit distance of the snowplow is the amount of snow it can move per unit time divided by how much snow needs to be moved per unit distance. See the following dimensional analysis:
$${distance \over time} = {{\text{cu-ft} \over time} \over {{\text{cu-ft} \over time} * time + \text{cu-ft} \over distance}}$$
$${distance \over time} = {distance * {\text{cu-ft} \over time} \over {\text{cu-ft} \over time} * time + \text{cu-ft}}$$
$${distance \over time} = {distance * {\text{cu-ft} \over time} \over \text{cu-ft} + \text{cu-ft}}$$
$${distance \over time} = {distance * \text{cu-ft} \over time * \text{cu-ft}}$$
$${distance \over time} = {distance \over time}$$

1. If we let t = 0 when the snow starts, $$$O$$$ becomes 0 (as there is no initial snow on the ground), and therefore we have $${dx \over dt} = {a\over r}t$$ If we let $$$k = {a \over r}$$$ we end up with the desired $${dx \over dt} = kt$$

Let's model this problem as:
$${df(t)\over dt} = kf(t)$$
$$f(t) = Ce^{kt}$$ 
with k representing the decline parameter of the drug. We need to find out both C and k.
We know the following:
$$f(0) = {45mg\over 1kg} * 50kg = 2250\;mg$$
5 hours earlier, we had double the amount of drug:
$$f(5) = {2f(0)} = 2 * 2250 = 4500\;mg$$
So we can then solve for $$$C,k$$$ to get a general formula:
$$f(0) = 2250 = Ce^{k0}$$
$$C = 2250$$
$$f(5) = 4500 = 2250e^{k5}$$
$$2 = e^{5k}$$
$$k = {ln(2)\over 5}$$
So we have
$$f(t) = 2250e^{ln(2)t\over 5}$$
Finding f(1) is therefore:
$$f(1) = 2250e^{ln(2)*1\over 5}$$
$$f(1) = 2250e^{ln(2)\over 5}$$
So to anesthetize the dog for an hour, we should give an amount equal to:
$$f(1) = \bbox[5px, border:2px solid black] {2584.57\;mg}$$
